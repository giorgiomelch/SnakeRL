# Snake Game - Solving with Reinforcement Learning
This project explores various Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to solve the classic Snake game. The main goal is to train agents to maximize their score by learning optimal policies for navigating the game board and collecting food while avoiding collisions.

For a comprehensive explanation of the approaches, training methods, and results, please refer to report.pdf. This file provides a detailed breakdown of each method, its performance, and the challenges faced during training.
